# Web Scraping Projects
## Introduction
This repository contains two Python projects focused on web scraping. The first project extracts data from a table on Wikipedia listing the biggest companies in the world. The second project involves scraping Amazon to track the price of a specific product.

## Background
Web scraping is a powerful technique used to extract data from websites. In these projects, I utilized **Python** along with libraries such as **BeautifulSoup** and **requests** to gather and parse HTML content from web pages. This technique is also important for **data analysts** to extract useful information from websites.

## Key Learning
- **HTML Parsing**: Through these projects, I gained a deeper understanding of how to parse and extract information from HTML pages.

- **XPath and CSS Selectors**: I explored XPath and CSS selectors to target specific elements within the HTML structure.

- **Requests Library**: I used the requests library to fetch the HTML content of web pages.

- **Data Processing**: After scraping the data, I learned techniques for cleaning and organizing it into usable formats such as CSV or JSON.

## Conclusion
These projects provided valuable hands-on experience with web scraping techniques using Python. By extracting data from Wikipedia and Amazon, I honed my skills in HTML parsing, data extraction, and automation. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own web scraping tasks.
